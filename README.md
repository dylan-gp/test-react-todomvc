## Implementation

The app was created using React and SCSS.  The src folder contains all of the source code.
The styles were written in scss and broken down into css.

The layout is as follows

### src
#### components (contains all the views)
* AppView.js
* InputBarView.js
* ListItemView.js
* ListView.js
* TitleBarView.js

#### containers (contains component logic)
* AppContainer.js (contains todo item state)
* InputBar.js
* ListItem.js
* ToDoList.js

#### styles
* App.css
* InputBarView.css
* InputBarView.scss
* ListView.css
* ListView.scss
* Style.css
* Style.scss (variable configuration)
* TitleBar.css
* TitleBar.scss

#### tests
* this is where future tests would go

#### utils
* localStorage.js
* registerServiceWorker.js


How was the app created? Anything worth sharing about the process of creating the app? Any spec violations?
